# AsciiDoc for Zed

AsciiDoc for Zed is an early-stage Zed extension and language-service project for first-class AsciiDoc, Asciidoctor, and Antora authoring.

The repository currently contains the initial Rust workspace, Zed language metadata, and foundational crates described in the PRDs under `docs/prd/`.

## Current Status

Implemented:

- Cargo workspace bootstrap.
- Thin registered Zed Wasm extension entry point.
- Zed language registration for `.adoc`, `.asciidoc`, and `.ad`.
- Pinned block and inline Tree-sitter grammars with highlighting, outline, and source-block injection queries.
  The grammars come from a fork whose `zed` branch carries five changes upstream does not have: a
  `table_header_row` node, so a table's header row can be styled apart from its body; comments that no
  longer close the section containing them, which previously left every heading below the first comment
  unparsed; document attribute values that accept globs (`src/**/*.kt`) and empty values (`:name: `);
  table cells written as `| text` that can carry block content, so an admonition or listing belonging to
  a cell no longer breaks the table around it; and constrained spans that keep word-internal delimiters,
  so `_"COMP1010_TUT01"_` is one italic run rather than several.
- Core AsciiDoc domain types.
- Minimal semantic parser for titles, sections, attributes, anchors, xrefs, and includes.
- Replacement-based workspace index and basic file/anchor definition resolution.
- Renderer abstraction and direct system Asciidoctor adapter for file or unsaved source, safe modes, attributes, and custom stylesheets.
- `adoc-ls` stdio transport with incremental synchronization, document symbols, diagnostics, and Go to Definition.
- Workspace indexing and conservative diagnostics for missing local xrefs, anchors, includes,
  and block images. An image is judged only in a file nothing includes, since Asciidoctor
  resolves it against the top-level document; inside an Antora module it is resolved as an
  `image$` resource of the page's module, and partials are not judged on their own.
  Opening, editing or closing any document refreshes the diagnostics of every open document,
  so a change in one file updates the warnings it causes or clears in another.
- Reference resolution that follows Asciidoctor and Antora semantics: module-root-relative page IDs,
  implicit and natural section references, anchors declared in included partials, and bibliography anchors.
- Antora descriptor parsing plus deterministic component, module, and resource-family discovery.
- Same-component Antora xref/include navigation and unknown module/resource diagnostics; components
  absent from the workspace are assumed to come from elsewhere in the playbook and are not reported.
  A target written as a resource ID that does not parse is reported as an invalid family
  (`partials$x.adoc`) or an invalid coordinate (too many, empty, or a malformed version); path
  errors are not, since Antora accepts relative forms the parser rejects. A file inside a
  component whose `antora.yml` cannot be read, or lacks `name`, is warned that Antora features
  are off for it; descriptors are read at start-up, so a fix shows after a server restart.
- Completion for `xref:` targets, `include::` targets, `image:` targets, and anchors.
  Inside an Antora module the current module's pages are offered as bare IDs and other
  modules' pages module-qualified, `include::` offers the family prefixes and then that
  family's resources, and anchors come from the file a target names. In a plain workspace
  the same constructs complete relative paths, including non-AsciiDoc include targets.
- Completion for attribute references after `{`, including inside macro targets such as
  `include::{partialsdir}`. It offers the document's own declarations, those of every file it
  includes, the component's `antora.yml` attributes, Antora's page and family-directory
  attributes, and Asciidoctor's built-ins, in that order of precedence, with each value shown
  alongside. Accepting a name supplies its closing brace, replacing one already present, and
  attributes the document unsets are left out.
- Hover over an xref, `<<anchor>>`, `include::` or `image::` to see the target's title, the
  section an anchor leads to, and where the target lives, as an Antora resource ID inside a
  component or a relative path elsewhere. Hover over an `{attribute}` to see its value and
  whether it comes from the document, an included file, `antora.yml`, Antora, or Asciidoctor.
  Targets resolve exactly as Go to Definition resolves them; unresolved ones show nothing.
- Workspace symbols: Zed's project symbol search finds document titles, section headings,
  explicit anchors and attribute declarations across the workspace by the start of any word
  in their names, so `auth` and `flow` both find "Authentication Flow".
- Antora navigation files (a module's `nav.adoc`, or a file `antora.yml` lists under `nav`)
  get page completion, Go to Definition and missing-page warnings like any page, and their
  outline is the navigation tree: `.Title` lines and `*`, `**`, … items nested by level, each
  linking item showing its `xref:` target. Ordinary documents' outlines nest sections by level.
  Zed builds outlines from Tree-sitter unless told otherwise, so to see these, set:

  ```json
  { "languages": { "AsciiDoc": { "document_symbols": "on" } } }
  ```
- Zed language-server registration using an `adoc-ls` executable available on `PATH`.
- HTML preview via two code actions. `AsciiDoc: render preview` renders once;
  `AsciiDoc: render live preview` additionally re-renders whenever the document is saved
  and embeds a reloader so the page keeps up; while a document is being followed that
  action becomes `AsciiDoc: stop live preview`, and closing the buffer stops it too. Both render the
  open buffer (saved or not) with Asciidoctor,
  merges the component's `antora.yml` `asciidoc.attributes` (where `true` sets an
  attribute, `false` and `~` unset it, and a trailing `@` lets the page override it)
  and Antora page and family-directory attributes (`moduledir`, `pagesdir`,
  `partialsdir`, `examplesdir`, `attachmentsdir`, `imagesdir`), rewrites
  family-qualified includes such as
  `partial$note.adoc` to absolute paths,
  and opens the result in the default browser. Includes nested inside an
  included file are rewritten too, via copies in a scratch directory; reading those
  copies is why preview renders with Asciidoctor's `unsafe` safe mode. Cyclic includes
  stop at the repeat rather than recursing.
- Small deterministic fixtures.

Not implemented yet:

- Cross-component/version Antora selection, diagnostics inside `antora.yml` itself, and
  re-reading descriptors when they change.
- Rename and references. The only code action is the preview command above.
- A preview pane inside Zed. The extension API exposes no webview or preview capability,
  so preview opens externally; see
  `docs/prd/DESIGN-Preview_Pipeline_and_Native_Rendering.md`.
- A pure-Rust renderer. Preview currently requires the `asciidoctor` executable on `PATH`.

## Development

Run the baseline checks before completing a change:

```sh
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p adoc-ls -- --version
```

Install the language-server executable before loading the repository root as a Zed dev extension:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/adoc-ls
```

Zed dev extension builds require Rust installed through `rustup` with the `wasm32-wasip2` target. Once loaded, the extension starts `adoc-ls --stdio` from `PATH` for AsciiDoc buffers.

Use `docs/prd/PRD-AsciiDoc_for_Zed_Initial_Implementation_Specification.md` as the implementation source of truth.
